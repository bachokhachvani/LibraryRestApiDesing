Authentication
For simplicity, we can assume a basic API key authentication method for all write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE).

Pagination
Responses for list operations should include pagination details, such as currentPage, totalPages, pageSize, and totalCount.

Caching
Caching should be applied to read operations (GET) at the server level. Use appropriate headers (Cache-Control, ETag) to manage cache behavior.

Error Handling
Errors should return a standard JSON structure that includes an error message and, optionally, a field for detailed error information.
